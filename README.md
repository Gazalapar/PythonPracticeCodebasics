(1)Variables: Python Variable is containers that store values. Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type.
A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location.
It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
Rules for Python variables
 1.A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
 2.A Python variable name cannot start with a number.
 3.A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
 4.Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).
 5.The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.
